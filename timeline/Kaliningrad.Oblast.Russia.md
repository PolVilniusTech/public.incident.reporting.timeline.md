*    Real sensitive data usually are stored not in the same Computer Network which are connected to the Internet.
*    From conversation logs there are chance to get specific sentences and words, which would link to the sensitive data, if we are taking in the account specific conversations between entities.
*    Such institutions as Memorial tries to fight the disinformation and separate Truth from some unknown chit-chats. Usually life are shown from though decisions which make You to think more about it.
*    Attacks from private-groups in CyberSpace on any Network without proper Agreement usually should be not allowed. Attack could not be called International, if these private-groups operates in the same Geographical Region, the same Country-State.
*    Allowing International attacks (without Agreement) from private-groups would make Internet Untrusted Space for most Internet Users, so it should be dealt like China do with Zero Covid Rule.
*    Similar Incidents show: Sometimes (untrusted) private-groups are using Public Person(s) for disclosure of the Information. Always this Public Person takes the blame for everything what were happened and usually no one cares, who hides behind those who grabbed the Information. Unless there are glimps of Human Rights which are Internationally taken as Granted and no one Violate these Rights for such Public Person, but usually switching the Job would be better Opinion to take care of such matters. Does Country-State offers anything for Old-timers?

*    If some Country could be attacked and usurbt faster than in two weeks then does these actions would be legitimized and approved later by some kind of Decorations? the Interpol can't cope with such Invasions.
*    Organisations should by white to black or black to white shall show the Sides which they Partner with. 
*    Assume: if checking of some background person in Internet would be plausible for International Interpol Forces, then losing access to such information would plausibly stop assasinations of regular Commoners.
