* Adopted Convention [lrs.lt](https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/TAIS.221141) allows to drift for the Ships approximately 12 Sea Miles from the Fixed Borders. Kind a Fence over the Sea idea are not in discussion & over the land it's already at best tech, e.g. [bbc.com](https://bbc.com/news/world-europe-58289893) when a Concrete Wall is named as a Fence. The Pylon-Buoy Tech [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoy).  
* Insurance usually has huge limitations and Terms of Use should be understood. Even Vehicles, that move in danger Zone could be left alone without any Support & Insurance. The China has made some movie about Alien tech, that probably are from Lithuania, which could move Land Vehicles in Combat from Danger Zone for Repairs. What about an Insurance for a Military Vehicles?
