##### L earning from Mistakes 

From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* The Article include statement „abupusius karinius patikrinimus“. This could look, that check is one-way check only.
* The Objective information on military matters, including transparency of military expenditures could be found in the UN.org by Year of 2014 [documents.un.org](https://documents.un.org/symbol-explorer?s=A/69/135&i=A/69/135_2452749).

Article of understandingwar.org provide a lot of information about Internet of Things device: Drone. In usual peace, this stuff would be used for agriculture sector too.
