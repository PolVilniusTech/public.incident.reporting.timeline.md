From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* When we dealing with merchandise or other payments which would be related with payment card processing we are dealing with PCI DSS or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard version i.e. 3.2.1. or newer. 
* Do not store sensitive authentication data contained in the payment card’s storage chip or full magnetic stripe, including the printed 3-4 digit card validation code on the front or back of the payment card after authorization.
* [PCI Security](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/standards_overview)
* Regularly Install Security Patches and Use Security Scan Tool from Official Site of the e-Commerce.

For Customers:
* Consider to replace Credit Card with new one, if lost information would do huge consequences.
* Consider possibility for restricting use of Credit Card after spending fixed amount of Money per Month.

Other ideas related to Physical Devices:

From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* Keep less quantity of the Data as much as possible (You can't lose the Data, which You don't Own)
* Does while registering for new Customer there would be possible to build WorkFlow in Stages 1-N? i.e. during Stage 1 You collect required data about the Driver, on other Stage for finishing making Service Available You are removing some personal data of the Client and leave only essential data for the Service like "date when license of the Driver expires" or so?
* Testing for Security Flaws regarding access to the Database.
* Management of the Database backups; testing functionality of those backups.
* Does there are defined policy(-ies) who should be able to access those backups?  
* [Password Storage (OWASP)](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html)

* Does anyone are giving mutual trust for such Service? Let say, at least HTML link from the trusted Government Subject and other trusted third party.
* Does the Security of such Service is going thru the audit process? If yes, then who doing this audit? Does the Auditor could be trusted?  
* If there is legal need for several people to access the some content, then each of person should use their own passwords.
* If You think that Your password are known, then You need to change it, but if there are Weaknesses in the Authentication mechanismus, then changing the password at best would help for the time depending how secure are used hash functions.
* Does hash rotation, when Security depend by not one, but several different strong hash functions, would improve the Security? If database would be leaked, then it would cost a lot more of computation power to reverse engineer different hash functions. 
* Does Services implement additional password security measures like pepper and salts? Pepper rotation depending by some status would help to improve the password security a lot.
