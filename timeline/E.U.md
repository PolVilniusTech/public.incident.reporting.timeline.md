Encryption has to be Unbreakable for National Security Infrastructure. If the Encryption could be Broken, then which Entities has such Resources and Finances to conduct such Operations?;
* The NATO Members [nato.int](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_52044.htm) Defends their Critical Infrastructure. Provided Incident in the Article is out of the Scope for the NATO.
* Missle Alarm Apps, which at first targets the Common Citizens to keep them alive does not Fit for the Number of International Legislations in the Number of Jurisdictions, which Commited to keep Health and Safety First of Common Citizens, Commoners, Combatants.
* Anti-Missle Defence System could be Targeted from the Astro-Space Sattelites Perspective.
