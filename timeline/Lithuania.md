* One of those entities has electronic mail, other does not have yet, so one of them has already registered hostname-domain name.
* Don't allow to register microsoft.<country_initials>, google.<country_initials>, because You would be sued for phishing attack on the Big Tech Company? There still exists problem for names like m1crosoft.<country_initials> or goog1e.<country_initials>, because this could be used for creating fake hostname-domain name services over Internet, over Digital e.Space.
* By returning back to previous entities, they sound similar, but one of them are with longer sentence. Usually people are too lazy to type more, so with shorter sentence hostname-domain name already with advantage, rest is only question of quality of service. Does those (up to year old) services saying the Truth in their Slogans. ing legitimacy for Payed Taxes to the Country Budget could be begint-started at first.
* Nowadays big tech companies are extending their Volume-Size by Creating Bigger Brand Name, so if those entities align in the purpose, which has the same target Audience, then it would be wise to do collab entity. Your Customers don't need to pay, i.e. twice with less money in both places. But if something happends with one fishy deal, other could reach the required destination.
* The Bigger Question in Letting register such names with capital and (or) non-capital letters which starts as "europol" shown in here as [BNS](https://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/verslas/4/1693782/gazprom-pranese-nutraukiantis-duju-tiekima-vamzdynu-jamalas-europa) and it could have links to entity, which are located in The Hague, Netherlands and is main law enforcement agency in the Continent.

The Problem with the Article - it does not say, if natural persons has lost/not lost their IP addresses. Leaked IP addresses could be used further to penetrate into deeper Network for finding out the real Identity of the Natural person and in this case such Telecommunication Networks of "Tele2", "Telia", "Bitė" would be the next Target. If the Internet Service Providers (ISP) distribute Static IP Addresses, then information of IP address would be personally identifiable information for Years in their Databases.

* There exists chance that some huge Brand would move into some Continent/Region and somebody want be re-sellers of the Domain in higher sum of Money.
* Usual price of a Domain could start from single one EUR'o, the Electricity prices and Administration cost increases it exponentialy.
* The Main Problem for Domains - does they belong to UTF-8 Charset or by default American Standard Code for Information Interchange one. The "xn--" solution are a "hack", which helps people live with the same tech for some longer time and more Internationalization. Opening "raštija.lt" it does not feel like it even looks like this: "https://xn--ratija-ckb.lt/" or in some gibberish serialized syntax.

In this case would need to question how big case could exists when somebody leave specific flaws in the technological phone application, which would allow for the bank to communicate with their customers in more secure way. These flaws would affect not only one person and instead every user of such app — affected.
* By taking first point as main, then there already exists number of services who offers telecomunication payments. If person could purchase something with help of "SMS" message, then there could be dangers, does this technological peace of equipment — phone technology is really without the flaws of being abused in similar fashion (pretending for donor care).
* Questioning about Bank services: Does bank offer service over the phone - call center? In this case client would call to bank instead i.e. to ask for some changes in the contract between the bank and person. If specific peace of information is enough to get money transfer done, then how would be dangerious, if someone else would get exact same peace info and for what reason would be using that?

```
##### L earning from Mistakes

From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* The Website which are imposing as "vmi.lt" has ".net" domain. In contrast domains like ".net", ".gov", ".edu", ".mil" are in many times "stronger" stance as something as single ".lt" domain name.
* The Portal of common domain purchase in U.S.A. is [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/en-ie/tlds/net-domain?countryview=1&isc=e1domgon1&countryview=1&currencyType=EUR), which allows to do World-Wide purchases and promotes original Country names on which they have been decided for themselves, in instance the "Türkiye".
* Exists domain name forwarding, i.e. by going into "vmi.net" could be made Browser forwarding from Server side into a Site of "vmi.lt". In this case everything could end up better than described in the "R esults".
* Bi-polar situation in the LTU, when there exists Site's like [Data Agency of the Country](https://www.stat.gov.lt/), when ".gov" domain name in use just after ".lt". And in the end we own normal domain ".gov.lt" for the Government domain + LTU domain. Now let us take the situation of sample domain of Lithuanian institution [IVPK](https://ivpk.lrv.lt/), which produce ".lrv" domain + ".lt" domain. This is equal situation of Government domain + LTU domain. Which one could be Trusted? or does they both (.gov.lt) and (.lrv.lt) are Trusted domains? where first represent TopLevelDomain + CountryCodeTopLevelDomain and second represent some simple Domain + CountryCodeTopLevelDomain.
* If there would be poor Country with small amount of technical personnel and skills maybe would be greater to pass such situation into those who control ".net" TopLevelDomain and would handle it according their jurisdiction. Some Samples with SecondLevelDomains could be found in here [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain).

No. Corrupted charging USB port could allow for a malicious actor to lock a device or extract personal data (emails, text messages, photos, contacts) & do not forget for something as password too. Take a sample that there could even be left some bunch of "infected cables". In the question: what to do? She could say: use electrical outlet instead of unknown USB charging port & cables.

* Provided Statements: How System could operate, when You complete administration work of something and afterwards all of this data vanishes. Does other information will vanish too? Who's responsible? What to do?
* System's Information are kept in a Database. When someone want to upgrade this System, he has to update from specific point, that has relationships with Database. New Update could affect relationships in Data, so there would be needed proffesionals Devs that could manage updates & database schema upgrades. When update are developed for very long period of time, then this problem could even increase. In ethical occasion normal System's has ticketing feedback to report errors in the System, plausible even to provide Questions and Answers. Everything depends by policies of a System. Security Representative have to not allow to start any administration without periodical  and later on occasional training for how to use the System. When there are no Security Representative for Educating System's Personel or even maybe he don't even understand the System's itself, then quality of a service could deteriorate & etc. etc. I don't think that You could get professional System Representative in Public Sector, because of many factors. In other words this Article would not be posted at all. There is a TREND, that Professional Teams of Developers from Private Sector take hands on System Development and provide adequate Service. Public Sector join knowledge & Personel into Teams to work with Datacenters, so they could afford optimal professionality and cost.
