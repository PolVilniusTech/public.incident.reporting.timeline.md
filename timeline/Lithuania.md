##### L earning from Mistakes 

From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* When we dealing with merchandise or other payments which would be related with payment card processing we are dealing with PCI DSS or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard version i.e. 3.2.1. or newer. 
* Do not store sensitive authentication data contained in the payment card’s storage chip or full magnetic stripe, including the printed 3-4 digit card validation code on the front or back of the payment card after authorization.
* [PCI Security](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/standards_overview)
* Regularly Install Security Patches and Use Security Scan Tool from Official Site of the e-Commerce.

For Customers:
* Consider to replace Credit Card with new one, if lost information would do huge consequences.
* Consider possibility for restricting use of Credit Card after spending fixed amount of Money per Month.

Other ideas related to Physical Devices:
* Check Credit Card Scanner Device's for Security Issues, test it out and if necessary — fix it.
