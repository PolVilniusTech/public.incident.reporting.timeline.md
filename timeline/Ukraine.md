From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* When we dealing with merchandise or other payments which would be related with payment card processing we are dealing with PCI DSS or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard version i.e. 3.2.1. or newer. 
* Do not store sensitive authentication data contained in the payment card’s storage chip or full magnetic stripe, including the printed 3-4 digit card validation code on the front or back of the payment card after authorization.
* [PCI Security](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/standards_overview)
* Regularly Install Security Patches and Use Security Scan Tool from Official Site of the e-Commerce.

For Customers:
* Consider to replace Credit Card with new one, if lost information would do huge consequences.
* Consider possibility for restricting use of Credit Card after spending fixed amount of Money per Month.

Other ideas related to Physical Devices:

From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* It's important to asses the risks for SCADA systems of using it together with public web sites, which uses the same external IP address. 
* SCADA system control panel could use different external IP address with additional security measures like VPN.
* If the SCADA system could be controled by administrators by using their web accounts then it's important to address all possible risks from the external Network.

Regular updates of the Website and it's Components, two-factor Authentication, Internal and External Security Tests are additional recommendation. And more examples from events, which were involved with Critical Infrastructure.
```

From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* If the System would be in list of the Critical Infrastructure, then build Website with tools like Microsoft FrontPage, which would write the Website main code, for example, without use of programming language(s).
* Take into the account that, if there are going to be build SCADA system for the Critical Infrastructure, it necessary to asses the Risks for making real world decissions.
* Does it's neccessary to Deploy such SCADA System with 100 percent precautions?

* Having multiple Telecommunication Companies, who are using different Paths of the Internet through Ground&Sea Cables to the Outside, could help to implement better Load Balancing of the Server(s). Different Telecommunication Technologies could be used for the same Reason. 
* Does Ground&Sea Cables, which go through Untrusted Area could be Trusted? If yes, then does Encipher&Decipher of the Data traffic are necessary? or does Telecommunication Companies are doing it and how well?
* Does Jurisdiction-Legislation of the Country permit such fill ups of data traffic? If it's not prohibited, then there are no Incident, which usually are solved by International Computer Response Teams with cooperation and help of the International Law. If such events would be stated as Violatile-Malicious-Criminal Activity, then connections with the Agencies like Interpol would be necessary. p.s. the Country need to build it's Expertise and Cooperation in the International Level.

* If such Apps would be used by Corrupted States-Countries. It would be needed to Ban the usage of mobile phones, laptops, smart gadgets in specific Sector where information leak would negatively affect Global Security Rating (counting cost of the loss and count of total damage).
* Such Apps could work by following (random ideas): I. reporting the Weakness and (or) Glitch to the Product of Tech Company and until it is not fixed by update or patch. Until then this Weakness would be used against somebody; II. by not having some Weakness and (or) Glitch to the Product of Tech Company would lead into not working App of Such Company as desired; III. some Weakness and (or) Glitch could be created with the intention and it is especially dangerious when there would be no Tech Professionals who would Fix it or in other words - the Product is too dangerious to be keept in the Production.
