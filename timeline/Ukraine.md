* Do not store sensitive authentication data contained in the payment card’s storage chip or full magnetic stripe, including the printed 3-4 digit card validation code on the front or back of the payment card after authorization.
* [PCI Security](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/standards_overview)

From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* If the System would be in list of the Critical Infrastructure, then build Website with tools like Microsoft FrontPage, which would write the Website main code, for example, without use of programming language(s).
* Take into the account that, if there are going to be build SCADA system for the Critical Infrastructure, it necessary to asses the Risks for making real world decissions.

From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* Sophisticated attacks mostly are backed by some Entity, which has the Power of backing it up. 
* Fixing with one "Criminal Entity", which are dangerious, would not solve the problem, because of the Power, which could get other Entity in days to do the same.
* Such Events are destroying reliability and Trust of the Internet and all good concepts what Tim Berners-Lee were done for.
* World Wide Web would Decentralise even more. Even less Truth and Trust in the Technology.
* Even small Kids could form a Team, but here huge Powers can't even decide on International Level what is Right and what is Wrong.
