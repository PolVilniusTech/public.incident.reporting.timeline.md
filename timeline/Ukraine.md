From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* When we dealing with merchandise or other payments which would be related with payment card processing we are dealing with PCI DSS or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard version i.e. 3.2.1. or newer. 
* Do not store sensitive authentication data contained in the payment card’s storage chip or full magnetic stripe, including the printed 3-4 digit card validation code on the front or back of the payment card after authorization.
* [PCI Security](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/standards_overview)
* Regularly Install Security Patches and Use Security Scan Tool from Official Site of the e-Commerce.

For Customers:
* Consider to replace Credit Card with new one, if lost information would do huge consequences.
* Consider possibility for restricting use of Credit Card after spending fixed amount of Money per Month.

Other ideas related to Physical Devices:
* Check Credit Card Scanner Device's for Security Issues, test it out and if necessary — fix it.

From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* If the System would be in list of the Critical Infrastructure, then build Website with tools like Microsoft FrontPage, which would write the Website main code, for example, without use of programming language(s).
* Take into the account that, if there are going to be build SCADA system for the Critical Infrastructure, it necessary to asses the Risks for making real world decissions.
* Does it's neccessary to Deploy such SCADA System with 100 percent precautions?

* Having multiple Telecommunication Companies, who are using different Paths of the Internet through Ground&Sea Cables to the Outside, could help to implement better Load Balancing of the Server(s). Different Telecommunication Technologies could be used for the same Reason. 
* Does Ground&Sea Cables, which go through Untrusted Area could be Trusted? If yes, then does Encipher&Decipher of the Data traffic are necessary? or does Telecommunication Companies are doing it and how well?
* Does Jurisdiction-Legislation of the Country permit such fill ups of data traffic? If it's not prohibited, then there are no Incident, which usually are solved by International Computer Response Teams with cooperation and help of the International Law. If such events would be stated as Violatile-Malicious-Criminal Activity, then connections with the Agencies like Interpol would be necessary. p.s. the Country need to build it's Expertise and Cooperation in the International Level.

From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* The Terms and Conditions of the [NSO Group Pegasus licence](https://www.nsogroup.com/terms-conditions/) looks more like Criminal Code of Specific Country or State, so at least You would know the Consequences, if You would wish to attemt and do something Fishy. Unfortunately other Country or State Law not equal to another Country or State Law, or has huge-smaller Similarities.
* Reglaments during the War and for so called Special Operations with Army, Militants, Military, Special Forces which would negatively effect the Country and (or) other Countries, Regulars and Commoners may not work as it should. And later on by Wasting of the Time would lead into searching for ScapeRabbit.
* Problems with Countries with Institutions who are using such Apps usualy lack or without concern of having Specialists who would approve and permit usage of such App. These Specialists could be linked to the Human Rights, Law Enforcement. Who would wish to tie their Arms? Some Immigrants had tied their Arms while in Lithuania. Who asked, if they are dangerious?
* If such Apps would be used by Corrupted States-Countries. It would be needed to Ban the usage of mobile phones, laptops, smart gadgets in specific Sector where information leak would negatively affect Global Security Rating (counting cost of the loss and count of total damage).
* Such Apps could work by following (random ideas): I. reporting the Weakness and (or) Glitch to the Product of Tech Company and until it is not fixed by update or patch. Until then this Weakness would be used against somebody; II. by not having some Weakness and (or) Glitch to the Product of Tech Company would lead into not working App of Such Company as desired; III. some Weakness and (or) Glitch could be created with the intention and it is especially dangerious when there would be no Tech Professionals who would Fix it or in other words - the Product is too dangerious to be keept in the Production.

From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* There should be providen possibility to prove the claims with their and local and international entities for Offensive, Crime, Forensic Investigation.
* According this News Media [LRT.lt](https://www.lrt.lt/mediateka/irasas/2000222076/zinios-ukraina-nori-kad-prekybos-centro-subombardavimo-byla-svarstytu-hagos-teismas) there already pille of Documents to pass it to the War Tribunal. According this News Media [LRT.lt](https://www.lrt.lt/mediateka/irasas/2000221971/zinios-del-vakar-susprogdinto-prekybos-centro-zelenskis-kviecia-susaukti-skubu-jt-saugumo-tarybos-posedi) there shown the need for participation in United Nations Security Council. Currently their Boss is from Tiny Country and it does not seem that anything could be changed in such Organisation.
* Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has observer status at the United Nations, but it should care more for the Security of the Europe. Does Agressor and the Victim are in the same Europe or no? Does OSCE are taking in account the Private Millitry Units from all Sides? The U.S.S.R-Russia-Russian Federation (following - Axis) belongs to the OSCE, but there are Helsinki Act which are white-to-black and black-to-white written that Sovereign and where these entities by joining should be accountable for full Integrity of the Borders for those Countries in the Europe. In Contrast, OSCE should be Integral sample of the NATO in the Europe Only.
* Axis and Isreal both are good at Building Homes in Abroad Lands, similarities with Palestine. Usually when You purchase the Flat, there would be e.Services and Services already in Place, but now the new Owner has to pay the bills. The Problem, that You should newer get e.Service and Service, if You don't have the Right Agreement, so all the e.Services and Services should be blocked until the Agreement are written and signed with regular signature and (or) qualified signature between the new Flat Owner and e.Service-Service provider. The Idea. What would happen when some Entity-Organisation are changing their name? Does the Citizens have to get new Identity Cards? but what if new Owner of the Entity-Organisation are not meeting the International Law which were signed by pre-decessor Owner?
* Aligning phrase of "Human Rights" with phrases of "Rights of the People" and in International level "Common Rights of the People" would be Wise, but the question: does these People have right to choose their Position?
* Other Problem is when the Church are bound with the Country and starts aligning with the events, which does not belong to the "Rights of the People", the People have the chance to choose and show their Position, but does there are pretty much the same with the Governments? who are building Republics and Democratic Countries.
* Here are other Dual-Face of the Organisation for which Ukraine wish to Join [-](https://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/eismas/7/1724507/draudimas-prekiauti-iprastais-automobiliais-tarsi-pandoros-skrynia-tiek-nauji-elektromobiliai-tiek-naudoti-dyzeliai-gali-tapti-sunkiai-iperkami). From Year of 2035 no new Vehicles with Combustion Engines and Only going into Renewables and so. Does this only shows that the Axis would get more Income from the Energy Export with their Nuclear Power Plants all around the World? In other Side, probably there only Funny Videos around and only one Tycoon who has such Tech in the Market. 
* Threats from Various Markets is like one Economic System are powered with Millitaty eq like Guns, Rockets and Nuclear Rockets, but does everyone align that Nuclear Rockets should be never used? Then what about Nuclear Power Plant(s)? In other sample of Economic System which are powered with Energy Production, Import and Export, but does Coal Power already is Threat to the Climate Change? which is first option for many Countries to Opt-out, like in other words, the Axis has Opt-out from all "Human Rights" Organisations which exists in this Planet Internally and Externally.

From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* There are question: from where the bombing were done (ground or air)?
* There are question: from which Side the bombing were done (Axis or not the Axis)?
* Does there are strong Chain of Evidence for the Offensive, Crime, Forensic Investigation?
* Nowadays Sattelites from the Space collects the data for various planes, Rocket Defence Systems sees every "Giant-Bug" in their Radars, Airports has some stuff to offer. If Axis would complete something like this from the Air, then it should be possible to add additional material into the document from the Previous Axis Invasion where Citizens from all of Europe lost their lives "Malaysia Plane Incident" which were done by Separatists from the Ground.
* There exists the term "false-flag" saying that the Entity which is at fault has done everything in their own allegations, in other words: killing your own kin. unfortunately from previous events of the Axis where they took off the flag of the Poland [ELTA](https://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/pasaulyje/6/1729655/zacharova-del-rusofobiskos-varsuvos-politikos-lenkijos-veliavai-ne-vieta-rusijos-memorialiniuose-kompleksuose) from the "Katyn Incident" (1940) it has the look for thinking that they are not guilty for this incident. Now after XXth century does everyone already forgot the Polands plane Crash with their High ranking Officials in the same Axis Soil? In that case Axis hidden all the Evidence and had not showing to anyone for long, long time. So it would be Wise to do properly and get International Team who could documment everything with Proper International agreement with exception that the Entity whos at fault should not use it's veto or anything, unless they have what to Hide. Usage of Cloud Document Management System with the access from various places of the World would be good Public backup. Cybersecurity in here would be required, i.e. every change has to be docummented until everyone comply with the final version.
