* When we dealing with merchandise or other payments which would be related with payment card processing we are dealing with PCI DSS or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard version i.e. 3.2.1. or newer. 
* Do not store sensitive authentication data contained in the payment card’s storage chip or full magnetic stripe, including the printed 3-4 digit card validation code on the front or back of the payment card after authorization.
* [PCI Security](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/standards_overview)

From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* If the System would be in list of the Critical Infrastructure, then build Website with tools like Microsoft FrontPage, which would write the Website main code, for example, without use of programming language(s).
* Take into the account that, if there are going to be build SCADA system for the Critical Infrastructure, it necessary to asses the Risks for making real world decissions.
* Does it's neccessary to Deploy such SCADA System with 100 percent precautions?   

TODO.
