From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* When we dealing with merchandise or other payments which would be related with payment card processing we are dealing with PCI DSS or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard version i.e. 3.2.1. or newer. 
* Do not store sensitive authentication data contained in the payment card’s storage chip or full magnetic stripe, including the printed 3-4 digit card validation code on the front or back of the payment card after authorization.
* [PCI Security](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/standards_overview)
* Regularly Install Security Patches and Use Security Scan Tool from Official Site of the e-Commerce.

For Customers:
* Consider to replace Credit Card with new one, if lost information would do huge consequences.
* Consider possibility for restricting use of Credit Card after spending fixed amount of Money per Month.

Other ideas related to Physical Devices:
* Check Credit Card Scanner Device's for Security Issues, test it out and if necessary — fix it.

```

```
##### R esults 

Website were filled with various messages for remembering what happened with the past Nuclear Power Plant in the region of the Europe and other concerns.

According [ESET](https://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/mokslas-ir-it/11/1397448/kibernetinio-saugumo-ekspertas-ivertino-incidenta-astravo-ae-tinklapyje-pateke-i-svarbia-sistema-programisiai-sugebetu-sustabdyti-ir-elektros-tiekima) for Website Security exists Web Application Firewall's, which enhances security from possible Vulnerabilities. Regular updates of the Website and it's Components, two-factor Authentication, Internal and External Security Tests are additional recommendation. And more examples from events, which were involved with Critical Infrastructure.
```

```
##### L earning from Mistakes 

From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* If the System would be in list of the Critical Infrastructure, then build Website with tools like Microsoft FrontPage, which would write the Website main code, for example, without use of programming language(s).
* Take into the account that, if there are going to be build SCADA system for the Critical Infrastructure, it necessary to asses the Risks for making real world decissions.
* Does it's neccessary to Deploy such SCADA System with 100 percent precautions?

Depending by Trust of those who Provide the Services there are still the Chance that during some period of time we will feel attack(s) of real huge Bot-net Networks.

From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* It's hard to describe if one day Unlicensed Services would start to go into Defencive stance of Humanity.
* Unlicensed Services usually does not guarantee the Quality of the Service, the Rights of the Client.
* If people has Hands on Unlicensed Services with Quality, then Country lack of Tools and Expertise to help the Service(s) for meeting Regulations of Segment in which it belongs, i.e. micro-service, small-service..

* Creators who live only from Donations could be exploited, someone are proposing ways for non-growth economical approach for at least until Crisis would be in the Past.

##### R esults 
Depending by e-Services, the Users of these Services will not be able to get Access, if they depend by them. 
There are possible negative effects from all around the World like CyberTerrorism or CyberDefence.

From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* The CyberTerrorist usually takes what not belong to them in the Current Legal Scope and the CyberDefence are protective means that CyberTerrorists would not exists.
* It would be Good to think about from which Country negative events happens and usually every evenkus thinks that the Country from which Border everything started are Aggressor or it would be good to learn Internetaional Law about such events.
* Usually Cowards hides behind Heroes, but Heroes usually dies Faster, so would be good to take negative Impact from Friends and Foes.
* Organisations does Penetration tests from Internal and External Sources, they are cappable to hold themselves depending their expertise, assets and knowledge. Those events always depend by Contract, i.e. B2B. In other hand, if we are talking about Country-Global wide events, then there could be used Services like G2B or B2G.

From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
*    Something is wrong with Geopolitical situation when half of people shout: Crisis and other half - (non-international) War. In Medic terms: In Contrast it look like Disabled who's on wheel chair.
*    Attackers and Defenders Political Systems shifts horizontically from Capitalism to Authoritarianism and back. In Medic terms: In Contrast it look like Authist who are cappable to do something. The Communism for very long already does not exist on these Parts of the World.

From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
*    Cyberspace does not have regular Boundaries because of such technology as VPN (Virtual Private Network) and there are more...
*    If Bank could be Shut Down, then it is nothing better than some kind of Institution for Saving Funds.
*    100% of Possibility into Increase of Off-shore companies which would be effected and would help to do the same what is not Available in the Country-State.
*    The Travel via (Space), Air, Road and (or) Sea are in Question.  
*    Attacks from private-groups in CyberSpace on any Network without proper Agreement usually should be not allowed. Attack could not be called International, if these private-groups operates in the same Geographical Region, the same Country-State.
*    Allowing International attacks (without Agreement) from private-groups would make Internet Untrusted Space for most Internet Users, so it should be dealt like China do with Zero Covid Rule.
*    Similar Incidents show: Sometimes (untrusted) private-groups are using Public Person(s) for disclosure of the Information. Always this Public Person takes the blame for everything what were happened and usually no one cares, who hides behind those who grabbed the Information. Unless there are glimps of Human Rights which are Internationally taken as Granted and no one Violate these Rights for such Public Person, but usually switching the Job would be better Opinion to take care of such matters. Does Country-State offers anything for Old-timers?

There will be less chance to do International Purchases and Payments for Services and Goods using Digital-Electronical means.

From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
*    Building logistic Centers would allow to use (Space), Air, Land and (or) Sea to Travel and get what You need.
*    Non-existent opposition in political system or puppet opposition in it would not change the Future, because there are no one who have the cappability to Control Country-State.

According this Information System funded by EU [rsc.lt](https://www.rsc.lt/radis/) there are one scanning station for the Gama Rays which exeeds the value of 500 nSv/h in the territory flaged as "BY".
```

```
##### R esults 
EUROPEAN RADIOACTIVITY DATA EXCHANGE PLATFORM does not have response function. 
This information only shall be taken for the awareness of Your own well being.
People could get sick by the Radioactivity.
```

```
##### L earning from Mistakes 

From such incidents there are possible to learn a lot. I.e.:
* In Lithuania the parameter bigger than 300 nSv/h shows that it exceeds (non-Maximum) the "Highest" Value for the Nuclear Event to be Reported.
* In the Pharmacies at the Lithuania in the Year of 2022 there were already given POTASSIUM IODIDE (expiry date of 12 2024) for free - 4 (four) per Family. The use of these Pills are Dangerious, so it's only counter-measure, if You are already affected, but in long term it's very not good to be dependent by them. 
* Don't use Equipment from the Nuclear Power Stations, even if they look Cool. These instruments may have left Gama Radioactivity. For this Reason there exists various physical instruments to scan the suroundings to catch the Gama radiation with using specific parameter values like Russian eq. of Ecovisor F4.
* Alternatively for the same Data there are e-service for "Gamma Dose Rate", which are displayed in here, URL: https://remap.jrc.ec.europa.eu/Simple.aspx (Luxembourg)
